        <h2>Public Speaking</h2>
        <p>I had been a member of Toastmasters international for 2 years between July 2017 and June 2020. I had been a vital part of the club taking on 2 leadership positions.As financial officer, I kept a record of the clubs accounts, ensured timely
            payments into and from the account, and managed the relationship with the venue where we hosted our meetings.<br /><br />In addition, I was the Sergeant-at-Arms where I was responsible for the safe keeping of the equipment and managing any
            stock checks and orders as needed.<br /><br />During my time, I became a highly competent speaker within the club where I competed within the yearly international competition. It was here that I defeated the reigning champion and progressed
            through the competition. Unfortunately, the competition was postponed due to Covid-19.<br /><br />Below is my speech that knocked out the champ.
