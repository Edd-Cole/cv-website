        <h2>Thread-It Back End - Solo Project</h2>
        <p>Thread it is a site designed to mimic reddit.</p>
        <p>The back end of the project was developed using TDD principles and refined further as the front end was worked on.</p>
        <p>The key functionality of the app is similar to a social media site. You can log in, create posts, add a new topic of discussion, leave comments, etc...</p>
        <p>The project was built using: Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. </p>
        <p>The hosted version can be found <a href="https://eddncnewsproject.herokuapp.com/api">here</a>. The repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/Edd-Cole/nc-news-back-end">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Coroamer Back End - Group Project</h2>
        <p>Coroamer was a group project, but I spent most of time building up the back end.</p>
        <p>I was key in getting the database and endpoints set up on time so the front end team could render the app with data.</p>
        <p>I am also responsible for the commenting throughout the repo, as I was keen on making sure that anyone who ventured into it would find it easy to follow.</p>
        <p>The tech stack used in building this was: Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Heroku and Express.js.</p>
