        <h2>Thread It - Solo Project</h2>
        <p>Thread It is a project that was designed to mimic Reddit in style and functionality.</p>
        <p>It was the first full stack project that I had created. It was built using a mobile first approach where the user could intuitively grasp the UI.</p>
        <p>The project was written with a variety of tech, most notably Node.js, React.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, HTML, {"&"} CSS.</p>
        <p>Here is a <a href="https://quizzical-stonebraker-f69ca3.netlify.app/" target="_blank">link</a> to the current hosted version. The current version only has suitable UI for mobile, so please use the dev tools to view it in mobile format.</p>
        <h2>Coroamer - Group Project</h2>
        <p>Coroamer is a mobile app that is designed to tackle the current travel restriction problem for travelers.</p>
        <p>The pandemic has left a lasting impact on many lives and many people wish they could have a small break from the doom and gloom.</p>
        <p>Coroamer's intention is to ease the finding of travel advice from governments by having it all in one location. Simply scroll to your destination and look up the restrictions.</p>
        <p>Coroamer was built using: React Native, TypeScript, Express.js {"&"} MongoDB.</p>
        <p>The app is not yet hosted, but it can be viewed on GitHub by following this <a href="https://github.com/CHARIOT-SEB/Covid-Travel-App-Frontend">link</a>. Here you can clone and pull the repo down.</p>
        <p>To view the app, follow the instructions in the README.md and ensure you have expo or some emulator installed.</p>
