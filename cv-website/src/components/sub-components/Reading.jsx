        <p>I love my fantasy books, I think it is such a great genre to get lost in. I love how we can create an entirely new world with our imagination. Where magic can exist, where bizarre creatures can exist and where tantalising puzzles exist.<br /><br />I'm
            currently digesting the opus magnum of Robert Jordan, <em>The Wheel of Time</em> Series, which is incredible. Other series that I love are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mistborn Trilogy - Brandon Sanderson</li>
            <li>Way of King Series - Brandon Sanderson</li>
            <li>Harry Potter Series - J.K. Rowling</li>
            <li>The Old Kingdom Series - Garth Nix</li>
            <li>His Dark Materials - Philip Pullman</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also have a number of non-fiction books that I love to read too. The big one I'm digesting is:
            <ul>
                <li>Java: The Complete Reference 11th Edition - Herbert Schildt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
